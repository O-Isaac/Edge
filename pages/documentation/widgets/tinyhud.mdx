_As promised, a small Horizon inspired reskin for LamasTinyHUD (a very lazy one) .
In no way this is finished, just a sample file that I did in half a day for you guys to play around.
I will still work on the animations and the icons in the future updates.
And yes, I will make a replacer version for Elden Equip as well._

## Requirements

<section className="overflow-auto max-w-full mt-4">

      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody className="[&>tr>th]:p-4 [&>tr>th]:border [&>tr>td]:p-4 [&>tr>td]:border">

        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

</section>

## Installation

Either install as a simple mod in you mod manager (overwriting both requirements above) or drop my HUD.svg file manually to `..\mods\LamasTinyHUD\SKSE\Plugins\resources\img` folder.

## Settings

After installation, make sure that you atleast set those two settings:

```toml copy
uBackgroundTransparency=255
uBackgroundIconTransparency=0
```

## Ultrawide

Also, Ultrawide gigachads, make sure you change the ** resolution** in lamastinyhuds MCM to yours, and lower the "**Scaling of HUD Image Width**" to something like 0.15
