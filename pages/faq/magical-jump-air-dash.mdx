**Q**: Which version of Magical jump mod should I download?
- **R**: _Doesn't matter_ 

**Q**: For some reason I don't have jump animations!
- **R**: _Download a mod like AddItemMenu > Use that spell/item from that mod > Select from the list mod called "doublejump.esp" > Take the "Enchanted Magic Ring" from there > Equip > JUMP!_

**Q**: How to dash?
- **R**: _Check your talent list (the same menu where magic is, just go to the lesser powers tab) > Select "Air Dash" > Press shout button (default "Z") > DASH!_

**Q**: I still don't have the lightning effect.
- **R**: _It's common problem since Magical Jumping 2.3 update. Make sure you set "explosion" setting instead of "platform" in "Visuals" tab in Magical Jump settings (In MCM menu)._

**Q**: I have extra visuals on the first jump that you don't have in your video!
- **R**: _Make sure you unchecked "First Hit Shader/Effect" setting in "Visuals" tab in Magical Jump settings (In MCM menu)._
