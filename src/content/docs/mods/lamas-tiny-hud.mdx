The replacer was heavily inspired by the quick slot menu from Horizon Zero Dawn game. Also I want to express my deep gratitude to the author of the original Lamas Tiny Hud mod @mlthelama, for the fact that he contributed to the technical implementation of this replacer, so don't forget to Endorse his mod! Premade (bottom-left) presets for 16x9 & 21x9 proportions are included in replacer, check FAQ below to understand how to apply them.
