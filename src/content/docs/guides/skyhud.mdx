Toggle HUD elements on or off, scale sizes, change positions and swap elements with alternative version. Features dot crosshair, slim compass, alternate ammo display, detached compass markers and built-in support for font mods.

## Edge UI with SkyHUD

Most of UI elements that you see on your screen in skyrim are controlled thru skyhud.txt, located in `*...\mods\Edge UI\interface\skyhud* folder`
*(if you use another UI replacer, change the path accordingly)*

import { Card } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

  The last skyhud.txt file in your loadlist (left MO2 panel) takes priority over everything else, so make sure that you're editing the very last one.

## Understanding the [Gameplay] Section

The `[Gameplay]` section of the SkyHUD configuration file controls various aspects of Skyrim's (HUD) behavior, specifically related to gameplay elements. 
Below is an example configuration with explanations of each setting:

```
[Gameplay]
bHideActivateButton=0   <- Toggles the [E] active interaction button.
bHideStealthText=0      <- Toggles the text notification [HIDDEN] while in stealth mode. Change to 0 if you want to display the Stealth Widget
bHideStealthMeter=1     <- Toggles the stealth status icon [The EYE icon] while in stealth mode. Change to 0 if you want to display the Stealth Widget
uPersistentMeter=1      <- This controls the Player Bars (Health/Stamina/Magicka) visibility. Values: 0 - Bars are only displayed when you take damage or sprint. 1 - Bars are always visible. 2 - Bars are always off
```

- **bHideActivateButton**: Set this option to 1 to hide the [E] interaction button, which appears when you can interact with objects or characters. By default (0), the button is visible.
- **bHideStealthText**: This controls the visibility of the "[HIDDEN]" text while sneaking. If set to 1, the text is hidden, which can be useful if you prefer a cleaner HUD when sneaking. The default is 0, which displays the text.
- **bHideStealthMeter**: This toggles the eye icon that indicates your stealth status. By default, it's set to 1 (hidden). Change this to 0 to show the icon while sneaking.
- **uPersistentMeter**: This setting determines when the player's health, stamina, and magicka bars are visible. Set to 0, the bars only appear when necessary (e.g., during combat or sprinting). A value of 1 keeps them visible at all times, while 2 hides them completely.

## Understanding the [Interface] Section

The `[Interface]` section in the SkyHUD configuration file controls elements of the game's user interface that are displayed on the screen. Below is an explanation of the available setting in this section

```
[Interface]
bShowClock=0    <- Turn In-game clock on/off

```

- **bShowClock**: This option controls whether an in-game clock is displayed on the HUD. Setting this to 1 enables the clock, showing the current time in Skyrim. Setting it to 0 disables the clock, resulting in a cleaner interface.

## Understanding the [Scale] Section

The `[Scale]` section of the SkyHUD configuration file is where you can adjust the size of various HUD elements to better suit your preferences. Each setting controls the scale of a specific UI component, allowing you to fine-tune the visual experience. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each option:

```
fClock=0.6              <- Clock Widget size
fHealth=1               <- Health bar size
fMagica=0.7             <- Magicka bar size
fStamina=0.7            <- Stamina bar size
fChargeMeter=1          <- Enchantment/Oxygen(if you use oxygen meter 1) meter size
fCrosshair=1.2          <- Default Crosshair size 
fCompass=0.85           <- Compass size
fCompassMarker=0.6      <- Compass Markers size
fSubtitle=0.8           <- Subtitles size (does not change the subtitle size in dialogues)
fStealthMeter=0.75      <- Stealth Meter size
fLocationInfo=0         <-  Default Location info notification
fMessageInfo=0.6        <- Size of text notifications, for example MCM mod initiations, Experience Gained, SunHelm conditions change etc
fArrowInfo=1.2          <- Arrow Widget size
fActivatePrompt=0       <- Default Interact Widget size
fObjectiveText=0.7      <- Quest objective notifications size
fLevelUpMeter=0.8       <- Levelling up notification size
fAnimatedLetters=0.5    <- Default Dragon Word learned/Skill Increased text size (currently redundant in Edge UI, as I use a different approach) 
```

- **fClock**: Adjusts the size of the in-game clock widget, if enabled in the [Interface] section. A value of 1 represents the default size, with values less than 1 shrinking the clock and values greater than 1 enlarging it.
- **fHealth**, fMagicka, fStamina: These control the sizes of the health, magicka, and stamina bars, respectively. Adjust these to make the bars more or less prominent based on your preferences.
- **fChargeMeter**: Controls the size of the enchantment charge meter or oxygen meter, depending on your setup.
- **fCrosshair**: Adjusts the size of the crosshair, allowing you to make it more noticeable or more subtle based on your preference.
- **fCompass**: Controls the size of the compass at the top of the screen, with fCompassMarker adjusting the size of the markers on the compass (e.g., quest markers, location markers).
- **fSubtitle**: Modifies the size of subtitles that appear during gameplay, though it does not affect dialogue subtitles.
- **fStealthMeter**: Adjusts the size of the stealth meter (eye icon) that indicates your stealth status when sneaking.
- **fLocationInfo**: Controls the size of location notifications that appear when you discover new areas.
- **fMessageInfo**: Alters the size of on-screen text notifications such as those from mods or system messages.
- **fArrowInfo**: Adjusts the size of the arrow widget that appears during gameplay, typically when indicating arrow counts or directions.
- **fActivatePrompt**: Changes the size of the interact widget, which appears when you can interact with objects or NPCs.
- **fObjectiveText**: Modifies the size of quest objective notifications that appear on screen.
- **fLevelUpMeter**: Controls the size of the notification that appears when you level up.
- **fAnimatedLetters**: Adjusts the size of animated text notifications, such as those for learning dragon words or increasing skills.

## Understanding the [Position] Section

<Card title="Quick note" icon="pencil">
  If the first parameter set to 1 (bLockCompass=, bLockMagickaMeter= etc),- it will use default position values, set it to 0 for it to take effect. Y is UP/DOWN position, X is LEFT/RIGHT
</Card>

The [Position] section of the SkyHUD configuration file allows you to customize the on-screen positioning of various HUD elements. This section gives you precise control over where each element appears, by adjusting the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates. Here's a breakdown of how each setting works:

```
[Position]

bLockHealthMeter=0
fHealthPosX=95          <- Health Bars X position. Lower numbers = move to the left, Higher = to the right
fHealthPosY=668         <- Health Bars Y position. Lower numbers = moves up, Higher = moves down

bLockMagickaMeter=0
fMagicaPosX=146         <- Magicka Bars X position. Lower numbers = move to the left, Higher = to the right
